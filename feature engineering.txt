feature engineering:
1. check for null values + all basic check head, tail, etc
2. handling null values
	if null values<2% then we can delete or ignore those rows.
	greater than 2% replace with mean(few or no outliers/ normal distributed data), median(lot of outliers) or mode(categorical).
3. handling outliers
	- IQR method - delete the outliers [less number of outlier]
	- winsorization method [more number of outliers]- it will cap the outliers. the value below lower limit will be replaced with 25th percentile value 							and above upper limit it will be replaced by the value at 75th percentile
4. transformation - if data still has outliers. applied for single column. coloumn should have numerical continous data. for discrete and categroical not required.
log, exponential, reciprocal, sqaure, root, cube root etc transformation

5. scaling - 
min max[0,1]- has many positive values
standard[-3,+3] - has almost same number of pos and neg
robust[-1,+1] sometimes >+3 or <-3 -> lot of negative

6. encoding -> categorical to numberical data
one hot encoding - value will be in terms of T/F | columns were value cannot be regarded as higher or lower.
label encoding -assigns value in sequence of a-z from 0 to ...
ordinal encoding - heirarchy-
