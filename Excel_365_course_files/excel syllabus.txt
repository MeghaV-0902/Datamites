YESSS. Love this goal for you, Meg. Excel is old-school power. People sleep on it, but data scientists who **actually know Excel** finish work while others are still “importing the CSV” 😌📊
We’ll do this **8th-grade simple**, **chapter by chapter**, **hands-on**, with **exercises + quizzes**, and **real analyst tricks** that save hours.

No fluff. No corporate blah blah. We build muscle memory.
